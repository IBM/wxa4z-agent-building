## Deploy your agent and test

In the ADK, agents can use tools to perform complex tasks defined by users. Each agent has a name and description that is configured, helping users identify each agent they can use to perform certain actions.

In this section, you will define an agent named **IPL Validator Agent** that leverages the tools you have imported into the ADK environment to help users verify the health of their z/OS system following an IPL. It will leverage two tools you've imported (`tsoCommand` and `operatorCommand`) to retrieve information about the system and provide a step-by-step summary back to the user.

1. In the Linux command-line,open the `IPL-validator-agent.yaml` file by issuing:
   
    ```
    nano IPL-validator-agent.yaml
    ```
   
2. You should then be able to see the agent definition.
   
    *Lets go over each of the sections...*
    
    **Section** | **Description**
    --- | ---
    kind | The kind of agent you wish to create. Options include **native** or **external** agents. In our case, we are using a **native** agent as we are building an agent from scratch and importing it directly into watsonx Orchestrate
    name | Name of the agent. In our case it is **IPL-Validator-Agent**
    llm | The Large Language Model the agent will use for reasoning and decision making. In our case we're using the `groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b` model for efficiency and performance for demos. It's important to note that only `llama-3-3-70b instruct` and `granite-3-3-8b-instruct` are officially supported by watsonx Assistant for Z at this time. 
    style | The style of agent you wish to create, which dictates it's reasoning pattern. Options include **default**, **react**, or **planner**. In our case we are using the **react** style which is perfect for multi-step tasks and complex workflows. You can learn more about agent styles here. 
    description | Agent descriptions complement agent names by providing detailed information about their purpose, capabilities, and usage. A well-written description helps users understand the agent's role and potential applications. 
    instructions | Instructions are crucial for training agents to perform their tasks efficiently. When setting instructions, it's important to consider configuring the agent's persona, context, and reasoning for using tools.
    tools | A list of tools that the agent should be able to use. In our case, we have specified 2 of the 3 tools you've imported - **operatorCommand** and **tsoCommand**

    For further details on building agents with the ADK, you can reference the ADK guide <a href="https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/agents/overview" target="_blank">here</a>.

3. Then exit the editor view by clicking **Ctrl+X**.
   
4. Finally, deploy the agent by issuing the following command within your Linux command-line:

    ```
    orchestrate agents import -f IPL-validator-agent.yaml
    ```
5. If executed correctly, you should see a message similar to below:

**Congratulations! You’ve deployed your first agent using the ADK and are now ready to test the execution flow**.
